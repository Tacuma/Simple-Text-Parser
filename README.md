Simple Text Parser
==================


Description:
============
This is a simple C program parses a select number of words from a text file. The program takes the file names "infile.txt", "outfile.txt", and two integers A and B as arguments, and parses whole words, starting at the Ath number of words in the passage and ending at B number of words in the passage.

#####terminal:
	takuma@ubuntu:~/Downloads/parser$ ./words infile.txt outfile.txt 5 15     

#####outfile.txt     
	Standard Code for Information Interchange. Computers can only understand numbers, so       


Input:

#####infile.txt
	ASCII stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Computers can only
	understand numbers, so an ASCII code is the numerical representation of a character such as
	'a' or '@' or an action of some sort. ASCII was developed a long time ago and now the non-
	printing characters are rarely used for their original purpose. Below is the ASCII character
	table and this includes descriptions of the first 32 non-printing characters. ASCII was
	actually designed for use with teletypes and so the descriptions are somewhat obscure. If
	someone says they want your CV however in ASCII format, all this means is they want 'plain'
	text with no formatting such as tabs, bold or underscoring - the raw format that any
	computer can understand. This is usually so they can easily import the file into their own
	applications without issues. Notepad.exe creates ASCII text, or in MS Word you can save a
	file as 'text only'
